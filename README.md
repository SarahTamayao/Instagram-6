# Project 4 - *Instagram*

**Instagram** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **28** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [X] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [X] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [X] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [X] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [X] User can pull to refresh the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [X] User can tap a post to view post details, including timestamp and caption.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Run your app on your phone and use the camera to take the photo
- [X] User can load more posts once he or she reaches the bottom of the feed using infinite scrolling.
- [X] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [X] User can use a Tab Bar to switch between a Home Feed tab (all posts) and a Profile tab (only posts published by the current user)
- User Profiles:
  - [ ] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
  - [ ] Display the profile photo with each post
  - [ ] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page
- [X] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse
- [ ] User can comment on a post and see all comments for each post in the post details screen.
- [X] User can like a post and see number of likes for each post in the post details screen. **I implemented likes on the home feed, but users can still see the number of likes and like/unlike a post**
- [ ] Style the login page to look like the real Instagram login page.
- [X] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed. ***maybe not exactly like the real thing, but working towards it**
- [ ] Implement a custom camera view.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can double tap on an image to like it, just like on the real Instagram
- [X] Feed automatically reloads every 10 minutes so that posts don't get too out of date
- [X] Usernames are shown with table view section headers on home feed

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I want to learn more about autolayout and styling on collection views -- there seem to be a lot of cool things you can do with them in terms of styling, but I'm not quite sure I know how yet.
2. I want to discuss further about using sections and section headers in table views. I think they are very useful, but it's a newer concept, and I think I could benefit from working with my peers on it for more practice and find situations in which they would be helpful.

## Notes

One challenging concept to grasp this week was table view sections. We had previously only worked with rwos, so having sections along with rows within sections was a new concept that came with a lot more intertwined functions. Understanding what the functions did and how they relate to the structure of the table view was a fun challenge!
